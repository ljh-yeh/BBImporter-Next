## Install

Unity's own Package Manager supports [importing packages through a URL to a Git repo](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html):

1. First, on this repository page, click the "Clone or download" button, and copy over this repository's HTTPS URL.  
2. Then click on the + button on the upper-left-hand corner of the Package Manager, select "Add package from git URL..." on the context menu, then paste this repo's URL!

While easy and straightforward, this method has a few major downside: it does not support dependency resolution and package upgrading when a new version is released.  To add support for that, the following method is recommended:

## LICENSE
